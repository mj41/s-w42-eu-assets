## robot3d: the robot in 3D, with any screen

A simplified 3D model of an M5Stack Stackchan robot, built in code from photos of a real one, and
a small renderer, all in Go (standard library only, no GPU, no cgo; the same pixels on every
machine). Put any picture on the robot's screen (a screenshot taken over USB, a frame of a
recording, a mock-up), turn its head, move the camera round it, light its LEDs.

```bash
go install github.com/mj41/s-w42-eu-assets/cmd/robot3d@latest

s-w42-eu-usb screenshot -o screen.jpg                  # the robot's screen over USB (320x240)
robot3d -screen screen.jpg -o robot.png                # the robot showing it (800x800, transparent)
robot3d -screen screen.jpg -az 30 -el 12 -pitch 25 -yaw 10 -o look-up.png
robot3d -screen screen.jpg -leds "#ff6a00*12" -bg "#f4f6ff" -o orange.png
robot3d -screen screen.jpg -frames 72 -o spin/%03d.png # the camera once round the robot
ffmpeg -framerate 24 -i spin/%03d.png -pix_fmt yuv420p spin.mp4
```

| Flag | |
|---|---|
| `-screen` | the screen's picture, JPEG or PNG, drawn 4:3; empty: the screen is off |
| `-brightness` | the screen, 0..1 |
| `-leds` | 12 colours, `#rrggbb` comma separated, numbered as the robot's `leds` command (left 0-5, right 6-11; 0 and 11 at the front); `#rrggbb*12` for all |
| `-yaw`, `-pitch` | the head in degrees, as the robot's `look` command: yaw + to the robot's left, pitch up from level (the robot allows 5..85) |
| `-az`, `-el` | the camera round the robot in degrees: 0, 0 is straight in front; + azimuth to the robot's left |
| `-zoom`, `-fov` | 1 fits the robot in any pose, so a moving head keeps a steady frame |
| `-size`, `-bg`, `-no-shadow`, `-ss` | the picture's size, its background (transparent if empty), the soft shadow on the ground, supersampling |
| `-frames`, `-turn` | frames of the camera going round by `-turn` degrees; `-o` is then a pattern |

From Go:

```go
img := robot3d.Render(robot3d.Options{Width: 800, Height: 800, Screen: screen, Pitch: 20, Azimuth: 25, Elevation: 10})
```

The model: M5Stack's structure files for the StackChan (`robot3d/m5stack/`, MIT, from
[m5stack/M5_Hardware](https://github.com/m5stack/M5_Hardware/tree/master/Products/K151_StackChan/Structures)):
the main body (the head behind the CoreS3, with its holes and LED slots), the base, the servo body
with the turntable and its back cover, placed by the dimensions in M5Stack's drawing
([docs](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/StackChan): 54 x 70.5 x 61.5 mm, the plate 8 high). Drawn
here: the CoreS3 (54 x 54 x 15.5) with the screen (40.8 x 30.6) in its black glass front, the red
ring and the sensors' dots, vents on the left, power button, USB-C and Grove port on the right; the
light guide bars of the LEDs, the labels (without text) and the upper back's panel. The head
pitches about the servo's horn, 24 mm above its bottom, right over the yaw axis.

## The pictures in the other repositories

All robot pictures in the docs, READMEs and pages come from here, so one change (the model, a
screen, a pose) refreshes them everywhere:

1. `screens/`: the robot's screens (320x240), e.g. from `s-w42-eu-usb screenshot -o x.jpg`.
2. `renders.json`: each picture: a still (one screen) or an animation (frames with captions), the
   head's pose, the camera, the LEDs, the size.
3. `go run ./cmd/robot3d-renders` writes `renders/` (stills PNG, animations GIF); `-only a,b`
   for some, `-check` fails if `renders/` is out of date. The same inputs give the same bytes.
4. `distribute.json`: where each picture goes (`repo:path`; the extension picks PNG, JPEG or GIF,
   `size` scales a still down); `repos` maps names to checkouts.
5. `go run ./cmd/robot3d-distribute -check` lists what is out of date; without `-check` it writes
   those files. It only writes: commit and push in each repository by its own rules.
